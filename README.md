Code and data will be provided in a public Zenodo DOI upon acceptance.


**Folders**:
 
 - **Scripts**: contains scripts for:
   
   (1) Curating and generating dissmilarity matrices (dissimilarity_calcss.R)
   
   (2) Providing general level analyses (LME) and MDS plots (general_summary_pub.R)
   
   (3) Analyzing temporal variation in algal metacommunity structure in response to treatments (gam_script.R)
   
   (4) Supplemental figures for showing treatment conditions across sites (background_analyses.R). Time series data for background analyses are not shared here and are available from links shared in code.

 - **Data**: contains curated raw data (algal percent covers), metadata, and data generated/used by functions. Separated by tropical (Moorea) and temperate (PPB) systems.
 - **Tables**: output from modeling and summaries.
 - **Figures**: figure outputs
